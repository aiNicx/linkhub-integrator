Queries are the bread and butter of your backend API. They fetch data from the database, check authentication or perform other business logic, and return data back to the client application.

This is an example query, taking in named arguments, reading data from the database and returning a result:

convex/myFunctions.ts
TS
import { query } from "./_generated/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

// Return the last 100 tasks in a given task list.
export const getTaskList = query({
  args: { taskListId: v.id("taskLists") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const tasks = await ctx.db
      .query("tasks")
      .filter((q) => q.eq(q.field("taskListId"), args.taskListId))
      .order("desc")
      .take(100);
    return tasks;
  },
});

Read on to understand how to build queries yourself.

Query names
Queries are defined in
TypeScript
files inside your convex/ directory.

The path and name of the file, as well as the way the function is exported from the file, determine the name the client will use to call it:

convex/myFunctions.ts
TS
// This function will be referred to as `api.myFunctions.myQuery`.
export const myQuery = …;

// This function will be referred to as `api.myFunctions.sum`.
export const sum = …;

To structure your API you can nest directories inside the convex/ directory:

convex/foo/myQueries.ts
TS
// This function will be referred to as `api.foo.myQueries.listMessages`.
export const listMessages = …;

Default exports receive the name default.

convex/myFunctions.ts
TS
// This function will be referred to as `api.myFunctions.default`.
export default …;

The same rules apply to mutations and actions, while HTTP actions use a different routing approach.

Client libraries in languages other than JavaScript and TypeScript use strings instead of API objects:

api.myFunctions.myQuery is "myFunctions:myQuery"
api.foo.myQueries.myQuery is "foo/myQueries:myQuery".
api.myFunction.default is "myFunction:default" or "myFunction".
The query constructor
To actually declare a query in Convex you use the query constructor function. Pass it an object with a handler function, which returns the query result:

convex/myFunctions.ts
TS
import { query } from "./_generated/server";

export const myConstantString = query({
  handler: () => {
    return "My never changing string";
  },
});

Query arguments
Queries accept named arguments. The argument values are accessible as fields of the second parameter of the handler function:

convex/myFunctions.ts
TS
import { query } from "./_generated/server";

export const sum = query({
  handler: (_, args: { a: number; b: number }) => {
    return args.a + args.b;
  },
});

Arguments and responses are automatically serialized and deserialized, and you can pass and return most value-like JavaScript data to and from your query.

To both declare the types of arguments and to validate them, add an args object using v validators:

convex/myFunctions.ts
TS
import { query } from "./_generated/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export const sum = query({
  args: { a: v.number(), b: v.number() },
  handler: (_, args) => {
    return args.a + args.b;
  },
});

See argument validation for the full list of supported types and validators.

The first parameter of the handler function contains the query context.

Query responses
Queries can return values of any supported Convex type which will be automatically serialized and deserialized.

Queries can also return undefined, which is not a valid Convex value. When a query returns undefined it is translated to null on the client.

Query context
The query constructor enables fetching data, and other Convex features by passing a QueryCtx object to the handler function as the first parameter:

convex/myFunctions.ts
TS
import { query } from "./_generated/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export const myQuery = query({
  args: { a: v.number(), b: v.number() },
  handler: (ctx, args) => {
    // Do something with `ctx`
  },
});

Which part of the query context is used depends on what your query needs to do:

To fetch from the database use the db field. Note that we make the handler function an async function so we can await the promise returned by db.get():

convex/myFunctions.ts
TS
import { query } from "./_generated/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export const getTask = query({
  args: { id: v.id("tasks") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    return await ctx.db.get(args.id);
  },
});

To return URLs to stored files use the storage field. Read more about File Storage.

To check user authentication use the auth field. Read more about Authentication.

Splitting up query code via helpers
When you want to split up the code in your query or reuse logic across multiple Convex functions you can define and call helper
TypeScript
functions:

convex/myFunctions.ts
TS
import { Id } from "./_generated/dataModel";
import { query, QueryCtx } from "./_generated/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export const getTaskAndAuthor = query({
  args: { id: v.id("tasks") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const task = await ctx.db.get(args.id);
    if (task === null) {
      return null;
    }
    return { task, author: await getUserName(ctx, task.authorId ?? null) };
  },
});

async function getUserName(ctx: QueryCtx, userId: Id<"users"> | null) {
  if (userId === null) {
    return null;
  }
  return (await ctx.db.get(userId))?.name;
}

You can export helpers to use them across multiple files. They will not be callable from outside of your Convex functions.

See Type annotating server side helpers for more guidance on TypeScript types.

Using NPM packages
Queries can import NPM packages installed in node_modules. Not all NPM packages are supported, see Runtimes for more details.

npm install @faker-js/faker

convex/myFunctions.ts
TS
import { query } from "./_generated/server";
import { faker } from "@faker-js/faker";

export const randomName = query({
  args: {},
  handler: () => {
    faker.seed();
    return faker.person.fullName();
  },
});

Calling queries from clients
To call a query from React use the useQuery hook along with the generated api object.

src/MyApp.tsx
TS
import { useQuery } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";

export function MyApp() {
  const data = useQuery(api.myFunctions.sum, { a: 1, b: 2 });
  // do something with `data`
}

See the React client documentation for all the ways queries can be called.

Caching & reactivity & consistency
Queries have three awesome attributes:

Caching: Convex caches query results automatically. If many clients request the same query, with the same arguments, they will receive a cached response.
Reactivity: clients can subscribe to queries to receive new results when the underlying data changes.
Consistency: All database reads inside a single query call are performed at the same logical timestamp. Concurrent writes do not affect the query results.
To have these attributes the handler function must be deterministic, which means that given the same arguments (including the query context) it will return the same response.

For this reason queries cannot fetch from third party APIs. To call third party APIs, use actions.

You might wonder whether you can use non-deterministic language functionality like Math.random() or Date.now(). The short answer is that Convex takes care of implementing these in a way that you don't have to think about the deterministic constraint.
